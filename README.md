# NYPD_Shooting_Project
Objective: Analyzed a comprehensive dataset from Data.gov, provided by the NYPD, covering shooting incidents in New York City from 2005 to 2022. The dataset contained 27,312 observations across 14 key variables, including incident details, perpetrator and victim demographics, and geographical data.

Tools & Technologies Used: R (ggplot2, lubridate, dplyr, leaflet), Kaggle for dataset sourcing.

Key Activities:
Data Cleaning: Implemented data preprocessing to handle missing values, resulting in a refined dataset of 27,300 observations with enhanced reliability for analysis.
Time Series Analysis: Conducted a detailed time series examination to identify trends in shooting incidents, revealing seasonal patterns and a significant spike during the 2020 Black Lives Matter protests.
Heatmap Visualization: Created heatmaps to visually represent the concentration of shootings involving black victims in specific boroughs, highlighting areas with higher incidences.
Regression Analysis: Performed logistic regression to investigate racial targeting, demonstrating a higher likelihood of black individuals being victims. Achieved an F1 score of 0.8285, indicating the model's robustness.

Results: The analysis underscored the disproportionate impact of shooting incidents on black individuals in NYC, with findings suggesting potential areas for policy intervention and further research.

Ethical Considerations: Addressed ethical concerns related to racial, selection, personal, and temporal biases in data analysis, advocating for a cautious interpretation of findings.

Future Directions: Expressed interest in exploring advanced regression techniques, comparing data across different jurisdictions, and examining international contexts to derive actionable insights for reducing gun violence.
